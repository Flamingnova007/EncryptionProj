Simulation is a useful tool to help individuals learn cloud computing concepts in a safe and controlled environment. 
Cloud simulations can be used to test different scenarios, configurations, and strategies without risking the failure of production environments. 
For example, simulating a DDoS attack on a cloud infrastructure can help security professionals understand the impact of such an attack and how to mitigate it. 
Similarly, cloud simulations can be used to test resource scaling, load balancing, and disaster recovery scenarios. 
Simulation also allows for experimentation with different cloud service models and deployment strategies.
